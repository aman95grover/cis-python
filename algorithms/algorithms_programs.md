- How are they the same.
- How are they different.

# Algorithms

> A list of steps to get to a finish result.

# Programs

> A program runs a set of defined tasks.

# Same

> They both require steps to reach a finish result.

# Different

> Programs can do tasks, as in Algorithms its only a list of tasks.
