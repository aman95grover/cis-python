Space to Fit
------------

We mentioned `first fit` and `best fit` as applied to finding parking spaces at a mall.
- Write a first fit algorithm for parking a car.
- Write a best fit algorithm for parking a car.

# First Fit

1. Find an open parking space.
2. Drive in the parking space.
3. Exit your car.
3. Enter the mall.

# Best Fit

1. Find an open parking space that is big so that one's car may fit.
2. Then drive in the parking space slowly watching both side to find out;
    1. You have room on both sides of the car
    2. Their is room to open the door.
    3. You are center in the parking space.
3. Exit your car and walk around the car to see you did well.
4. If you did not do will, get back in the car and start from step `1` again.
5. When all the above tasks are done you may exit your can and enter the mall.

# Conclusion

The first fit is way simpler to get you in the mall first.
The reason is that their are less checks one has to do.
